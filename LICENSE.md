# SimpleBLE License

SimpleBLE is available under the Business Source License 1.1 (BUSL-1.1).

This means that the project is free to use for non-commercial purposes, but requires a commercial
license for production or commercial use. Each version of SimpleBLE will convert to the GNU General
Public License version 3 after four years of its initial release.

**Change Date:** The fourth anniversary of the first publicly available distribution of a specific
version of SimpleBLE under this License.

**Change License:** GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPL-3.0)

**Non-Commercial Perpetual Use Grant:** After the Change Date, non-commercial users (individuals,
hobbyists, educational institutions, and revenue-free open-source projects) are granted
perpetual rights to use this specific version under the original BUSL-1.1 terms, notwithstanding the
automatic conversion to GPL-3.

## Frequently Asked Questions

If you have any questions regarding licensing, please [email us](mailto:contact@simpleble.org) or [leave us a message on our website](https://www.simpleble.org/contact?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=simpleble_license).

**I would like to use SimpleBLE commercially, and don't have a commercial license. What should I do?**

Please [email us](mailto:contact@simpleble.org) or [leave us a message on our website](https://www.simpleble.org/contact?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=simpleble_license)
and we can discuss the specifics of your situation. We have a free commercial license option for small
projects and early-stage companies and very flexible commercial licensing options for larger projects.

**I already have a commercial license. Do any Business Source License 1.1 terms affect me?**

No, you are only bound to the terms of the commercial license you hold. The Business Source License
1.1 terms only apply to users who do not have a commercial license.

**What exactly can I do with SimpleBLE for free under non-commercial use?**

The Business Source License 1.1 (BUSL-1.1) allows free non-commercial use of the software, including
copying, modifying, creating derivatives, redistributing, and non-production activities like
development, testing, or personal/hobby projects. For purely non-commercial scenarios with no financial
gain, these rights are available without needing extra permission.

**What does the Business Source License 1.1 allow and restrict?**

The Business Source License allows non-production use, such as development and testing in isolated
environments. However, any use that could be considered production (including internal tools,
revenue-generating projects, or customer-facing deployments) requires purchasing a commercial license.

After four years of the initial release of a given version of SimpleBLE, the license automatically
converts to the GNU General Public License version 3.

For details on what counts as free non-commercial use and distribution requirements, see the FAQs below.

**Can I include SimpleBLE in my own open-source project and release it under MIT/Apache/BSD?**

When distributing any version that includes SimpleBLE code (whether unchanged, modified, or as part
of a larger project), downstream users must include the full BUSL-1.1 license text prominently with
their distribution and ensure that the SimpleBLE portion remains under the same BUSL terms for recipients.

This applies even if your overall project uses a permissive license like MIT or Apache. The SimpleBLE
code cannot be re-licensed to recipients under MIT/Apache alone. Recipients must still receive the
SimpleBLE portion under BUSL-1.1 (typically by including the BUSL license file and any required notices).

After the Change Date, GPL-3.0 rules apply for everyone except qualifying non-commercial users, who
may continue using and distributing under the original BUSL-1.1 terms per the Non-Commercial Perpetual
Use Grant.

**What does the "Non-Commercial Perpetual Use Grant" mean?**

After the Change Date (four years after a version's release), that version automatically converts to
GPL-3.0 for everyone. However, purely non-commercial users (individuals, hobbyists, educational
institutions, and revenue-free open-source projects) may continue using that specific version
indefinitely under the original BUSL-1.1 terms instead of switching to GPL-3.0.

This means you can keep the more permissive BUSL-style rights (e.g., no requirement to license your
derivatives under GPL) as long as your use remains strictly non-commercial.

**What do you consider "commercial use"?**

Commercial use in the context of SimpleBLE refers to any usage of the library or its derivatives in
a commercial setting where it contributes, either directly or indirectly, to financial gain. This
includes, but is not limited to, incorporating SimpleBLE into commercial software products, using it
in the development of services offered for a fee, or deploying it within internal tools or software
in a for-profit organization where it adds business value.

**Why do I need to pay for commercial use?**

Commercial licensing enables us to sustainably maintain and enhance SimpleBLE, particularly given
its growing adoption in critical sectors like medical and industrial applications. The revenue
from commercial licenses allows us to provide robust support, maintain compatibility with evolving
underlying APIs, and invest in improvements that benefit all users. This includes expanded
language support, better testing infrastructure, and more comprehensive documentation. While
SimpleBLE remains freely available for non-commercial use, the Business Source License ensures we
can continue providing the level of reliability and support that commercial applications require.
