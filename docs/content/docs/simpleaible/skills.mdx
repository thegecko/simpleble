SimpleAIBLE provides a set of **Agent Skills** that teach your AI assistant (Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, etc.) how to effectively use the SimpleAIBLE MCP server and debug Bluetooth Low Energy connections.

## What are Agent Skills?

Agent skills are reusable instruction sets that provide domain-specific knowledge to your AI. The `simpleaible` skill includes**:**

- **Recommended Workflows**: Step-by-step guidance on scanning, connecting, and interacting with devices.
- **Platform Knowledge**: Awareness of differences between macOS UUIDs and Linux MAC addresses.
- **Debugging Patterns**: Pre-defined strategies for troubleshooting connection and discovery issues.

## Installation

You can install the SimpleAIBLE skill using the `skills` CLI. This works across multiple agents including Cursor, Claude Code, and others.

### Using npx (Recommended)

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/simpleble/simpleble --skill simpleaible
```

### Options

- **Target specific agents**: Use `-a` or `--agent` (e.g., `-a cursor -a claude-code`).
- **Global installation**: Use `-g` or `--global` to make the skill available across all your projects.

## Usage in Agents

Once installed, your agent will automatically "activate" the skill when it detects you are working on Bluetooth-related tasks. You can trigger it by asking questions like:

- *"I'm debugging my peripheral, please ensure it is connectable and I can read some data."*
- *"I'm not finding any device, please see if you can find any BLE device."*
- *"Read the firmware version from the device at address AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF."*

## Supported Agents

The skill follows the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io) and is compatible with:

- **Cursor**
- **Claude Code**
- **Windsurf**
- **Cline**
- **Roo Code**
- ... and many more.
