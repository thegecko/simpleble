SimpleCBLE wraps the SimpleBLE C++ library. Therefore, all platform-specific notes, limitations, and behaviors documented for SimpleBLE apply to SimpleCBLE as well.

Please refer to the [SimpleBLE Platform Notes](../simpleble/platform_notes) for detailed information regarding:

- **Windows**: Architecture mismatch (32-bit vs 64-bit) and adapter selection issues.
- **MacOS / iOS**: UUIDs instead of MAC addresses, and connection management limitations.
- **Linux**: Scanning delays.
- **Android**: API level limitations and bond management.
