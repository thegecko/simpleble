## Building documentation

The documentation for SimpleBLE is built using [Fumadocs](https://fumadocs.vercel.app/), a Next.js-based documentation framework.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ or Bun
- npm, pnpm, or bun package manager

### Installation

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
cd <path-to-repository>/docs-new
npm install
# or
bun install
```

### Development

To run the documentation site in development mode with hot reload:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
bun dev
```

The documentation will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Building for Production

To build the documentation for production:

```bash
npm run build
# or
bun run build
```

To preview the production build locally:

```bash
npm run start
# or
bun start
```

### Content Structure

- **Content files**: Located in `docs-new/content/docs/`
- **Components**: Located in `docs-new/src/components/`
- **API documentation**: Generated using custom React components in `docs-new/src/components/api/`

Documentation is written in MDX (Markdown with JSX), allowing you to use React components within your documentation.

## Release checklist

Before releasing a new version of the project, the following steps should be performed:

1. Ensure content parity between all readmes and the documentation.

   - `README.rst`
   - `LICENSE.md`
   - `simplepyble/README.rst`
   - `simplersble/README.md`

2. Review the version number in the following files, make sure they match:

   - `VERSION`
   - `Cargo.toml` (Remove the -dev1 suffix)
   - `docs/content/docs/changelog.rst` (Add the release date)

3. Commit the changes to the repository.

4. Tag the commit with the new version number.

5. Push the commit and the tag to the remote repository.

6. Create a new release on GitHub.

7. Wait for `ci_release.yml` to finish.

8. Advance the version number in the following files:

   - `VERSION`
   - `Cargo.toml` (and include a `-dev1` suffix)
   - `docs/content/docs/changelog.rst`

9. Run `cargo build` to ensure that `Cargo.toml` is correct.
