---

SimpleBLE works on Windows, Linux and MacOS. Please follow the instructions below to build and run SimplePyBLE in your specific environment.

## Installing from PyPI

The fastest way to get going with SimplePyBLE is to install it from PyPI:

```bash
pip install simplepyble
```

Please take into consideration that when using this library on Linux, you will need to have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libdbus-1-dev
```

## Installing locally

If you wish to install SimplePyBLE locally, either for development purposes or to access the latest features, you can do so by cloning the repository and installing it with pip:

```bash
cd <path-to-simpleble>/simplepyble
pip install .
```

## Built-in REST Server

SimplePyBLE includes a built-in REST server that allows you to control BLE devices using a REST API. To use the server, you need to install the optional dependencies:

```bash
pip install simplepyble[server]
```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the server using the following command:

```bash
python3 -m simplepyble.server --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

## API Endpoints

The server provides the following endpoints:

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `GET` | `/` | Returns a status message. |
| `GET` | `/adapters` | Returns a list of available Bluetooth adapters. |
| `POST` | `/scan` | Scans for nearby BLE devices (optional `timeout_ms` query param). |
| `POST` | `/connect/{address}` | Connects to a device by its address. |
| `POST` | `/disconnect/{address}` | Disconnects from a device. |
| `GET` | `/device/{address}` | Returns information about a connected device. |
| `POST` | `/device/{address}/read/{service}/{char}` | Reads the value of a characteristic. |
| `POST` | `/device/{address}/write/{service}/{char}` | Writes a value (Request). Body: `{"data": "hex"}`. |
| `POST` | `/device/{address}/write_command/{service}/{char}` | Writes a value (Command). Body: `{"data": "hex"}`. |
| `POST` | `/device/{address}/notify/{service}/{char}` | Subscribes to notifications. |
| `POST` | `/device/{address}/indicate/{service}/{char}` | Subscribes to indications. |
| `POST` | `/device/{address}/unsubscribe/{service}/{char}` | Unsubscribes from notifications/indications. |
| `GET` | `/device/{address}/notifications` | Retrieves and clears received notifications. |

## Interactive Documentation
